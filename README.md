# My Profile with CI/CD

This is my personal profile a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and Deploy to [`GitHub Pages`](https://pages.github.com/) using [`GitHub Actions`](https://github.com/features/actions).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash

pnpm dev # recommend packgage manager
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
